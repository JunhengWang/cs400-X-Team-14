# X-Team 14 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
1. Assign tasks by preferences first (ie who wants to do what)
2. Then remaining tasks will be broken up and distributed to create even workloads
3. Reasssigning tasks will occur if team member is unable to complete task or needs help in completion

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
1. Set milestones for each task
2. Set dates that milestones should be complete
3. Check in with teammates on scheduled basis for update on progress

## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
Asking questions to clarify tasks if not clear what goal is. Also, getting
help from teammate that is ahead in their task or understands problem better.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
Giving continuous updates of progress on tasks. If a teammate is too far behind or is unable to 
complete the task by the deadline, workload will be distributed to ensure deadlines are not missed.

## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
Respect each other's ideas.
